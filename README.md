## Description of the Project

Briefly describe what this Java console application does. Mention its purpose and who the intended users are. Explain the main functionality and what problems it aims to solve.



## User Stories

List the user stories that guided the development of your application. Format these stories as: "As a [type of user], I want [some goal] so that [some reason]."

- As a user, I want to have a custom option to filter transactions, so I can provide the values for the filtering to have flexible search ability
- As a user, I want to filter reports based on the vendor, so I can see a specific list of transactions according to my needs
- As a user, I want to filter reports based on the date, so I can better understand the transaction within a certain timer period
- As a user, I want to have a reports' menu, so I can navigate different filtering options easily
- As a user, I want to see all payments, so I can filter down the output for all payments
- As a user, I want to see all deposits, so I can filter down the output for all deposits
- As a user, I want to be able to see all the transactions, so I can review all the transactions I have
- As a user, I want to add a deposit, so I can update the transactions list with new deposits.
- As a user, I want to add a payment, so I can have the most updated list of transactions with new payments
- As a user, I want to see a home screen menu, so I can navigate to different features of the application from the menu
- As a user, I want to see a ledger menu, so I can navigate different transactions output screens easily
